  { term: 'ICMR', definition: 'Indian Council of Medical Research; publishes nutrition guidelines and RDAs for India. Established in 1911, ICMR is India\'s apex body for biomedical research and provides evidence-based dietary recommendations through the National Institute of Nutrition. The ICMR-NIN expert committee regularly updates Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Indians, considering local food patterns, climate, and nutritional challenges. These guidelines form the scientific basis for India\'s food safety standards, nutrition programs, and public health policies. ICMR also conducts large-scale nutrition surveys like the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) studies to assess dietary intakes and nutritional status across Indian states.', category: 'Institutions' },
  { term: 'NIN', definition: 'National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad; leads nutrition research and publishes IFCT. Founded in 1918, NIN is one of the oldest nutrition research institutes in the world and serves as the nodal agency for nutrition research in India.

NIN publishes the Indian Food Composition Tables (IFCT) which provides comprehensive nutritional data on over 500 Indian foods, essential for dietary assessment and nutrition planning. The institute also develops nutrition education materials, trains nutrition professionals, and provides technical support to government programs like POSHAN Abhiyaan and ICDS.', category: 'Institutions', aliases: ['National Institute of Nutrition'] },
  { term: 'IFCT', definition: 'Indian Food Composition Tables; nutrient values for Indian foods compiled by NIN. The IFCT is a comprehensive database containing nutritional composition data for over 500 commonly consumed Indian foods, including regional varieties and traditional preparations. Published by the National Institute of Nutrition, these tables provide detailed information on macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds specific to Indian cuisine. The data is essential for nutritionists, dietitians, and researchers to assess dietary intakes, plan balanced meals, and formulate nutrition policies. IFCT values account for traditional cooking methods, food processing techniques, and regional variations that affect nutrient content in Indian foods, making them more accurate for Indian dietary assessments than international databases.', category: 'References' },
